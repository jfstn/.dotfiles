# .dotfiles

A set of macOS dotfiles with custom configuration for tmux, vim, git and zsh.
Includes brew installed programs list, ubuntu mono powerline font with nerd icons and iterm colorscheme.

## installation

_WIP_

Before running `install.sh`:

-   `.config`: remove lines that match directories that you don't want installed;
-   Don't worry about dotfiles getting replaced. A backup will be made.

To install run `./install.sh`

## tmux

## vim
